# Simple GUI Calculator

This is a simple graphical calculator built with Python and the `tkinter` library. It provides a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations.

## Project Overview

The Simple GUI Calculator is a desktop application that allows you to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. It's a great example of how to create a simple GUI application with Python's built-in `tkinter` library.

This project is perfect for beginners who are learning about GUI programming in Python.

## Features

*   **Basic arithmetic operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Graphical user interface:** Provides a simple and intuitive interface with input fields, radio buttons for selecting the operator, and a calculate button.
*   **Cross-platform:** Since it's built with `tkinter`, it should run on any platform that has Python installed.

## Technologies Used

*   **Language:** Python
*   **GUI Library:** [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

## Installation and Setup

To run this calculator, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. The `tkinter` library is included with most standard Python installations.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/init050/calculator.git
    cd calculator
    ```

## How to Use

1.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python Untitled-1.py
    ```
    (It's recommended to rename `Untitled-1.py` to something more descriptive, like `calculator.py`.)

2.  **Use the calculator:**
    *   Enter the first number in the "Number 1" field.
    *   Enter the second number in the "Number 2" field.
    *   Select the desired operation (+, -, *, /) using the radio buttons.
    *   Click the "Calculate" button to see the result.

## Future Improvements

*   **More advanced operations:** Add support for more complex operations like exponents, square roots, and trigonometric functions.
*   **Improved layout:** Use a more sophisticated layout manager to create a more visually appealing interface.
*   **Keyboard support:** Allow the user to perform calculations using the keyboard in addition to the mouse.
*   **Error handling:** Add error handling for cases like division by zero or invalid input.
*   **History feature:** Add a history panel to show previous calculations.
